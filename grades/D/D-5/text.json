"Like two peas in a pod,",
"A fish and fishing-rod",
"A hot-dog and a bun, we get along,",
"A pair of shoes and socks",
"A bagel and some lox,",
"Together is the place where we belong.",
"Tell me what are things that make a duo",
"What are stuff that always need a mate,",
"Like sisters and their brothers need each other",
"Like two-plus-two is four, ",
"and four-plus-four is eight.",
"Like lemons go with limes",
"And nickels go with dimes",
"Like ice-cream and a cone, we get along",
"Gefilte-fish and chrein",
"A pilot and his plane",
"Together is the place where we belong!"
