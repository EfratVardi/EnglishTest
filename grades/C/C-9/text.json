"Mrs. Weiss's desk",
         "Bli neder…that was the last carpool I'll ever do. ",
         " I just got back now!",
         "What took you so long? ",
          "You should have been back an hour ago.",
         "To  begin with, Raizy didn't want to get into the car",
         ". She said her mother doesn't let her drive with strangers.  ",
        "Then there was a little kid whose name tag fell off her dress,",
         "and she didn't know who she was! ",
         " Nechi cried for 3 blocks because she left her lunch box in school, ",
         "so I had to back to get it. ",
        " But that didn't take an hour!",
        " I'm not finished! ",
        "Raizy- If I never see that kid again it will be too soon. ",
         "She was the last one and she wouldn't tell me where she lives,",
         "because she doesn't talk to strangers",
         "So I gave her a taffy to make friends",
         "I must have driven around Yerushalayim for a half hour before she said 'that's my house'" ",
         "why didn't you tell me before?  You know what she said?  ",
        "I'm not allowed to talk with food in my mouth ",
         "Don't you ever do this to me again!",
         "I'm really sorry..oops",
         "there goes my buzzer. The boss wants me ",
         "I'll see you later tonight."
